## Product Overview and Summary. 

Connect with Tech enables users to post, video chat, apply to job offers, message people, comment, search with keywords or hashtags, and follow engineers whose work inspires them. 

CWT is a platform that allows engineering users to showcase their work experience and use it as a resume. It enables business users to search for and hire suitable candidates and connect and communicate with them. Engineering users can apply for jobs, schedule interviews, and engage with other professionals in the industry. They can also follow and interact with people who inspire them.

## The Problem 
Since covid, there has been a loss of jobs in the tech industry. People are getting laid off, and newcomers aren't being hired because of a lack of experience.  This has become a real problem because people with unconventional talents for employability in the tech industry are disregarded because of their nontraditional academic background. 

## Solution
CWT will have a page for a business post for freelance work instead of just reading applicants' resumes. A business can see their experience by viewing their previous web applications on their profile. Also, CWT gives businesses a chance to interview them on the site. CWTâ€™s goal is to limit how long the interview process is. Lastly, CWT gives engineers a place to gain inspiration from other engineers by viewing posts and following others. 

## Key Technical Challenges
Some technical challenges would be integrating multiple communication streams within our app using WebSockets to make live chats and video calls. Also, I want to learn about TypeScript to improve the developer experience because TypeScript is more reliable in helping catch errors since this is an extensive application. 

## Extension Opportunities 
Some extension opportunities include building a page for users to ask questions about coding problems users are having and setting up a meeting with multiple people in a video chat. Also, adding images by importing them and saving them to a back-end cloud using Cloudinary API and widgets.
